My name is Anurag Jain, I'm a software developer in India.

This is my personal blog where I write about programming, C++, computer science, Algorithms, distributed systems, and more.
I'm mainly interested in:

* C++
* Software Design
* Distributed systems
* Optimization and Efficiency

It goes without saying that all expressed opinions are solely my own.
